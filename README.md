Get data from Meteostat API  into R

## Context
This R package is part of my *okeanos* suite of R packages. 

The idea behind the *okeanos* suite is to develop R packages that make will it easy to fetch various data (mainly time series) into R in a consistent manner and 
to reduce the time needed to get the data into R session.

## Legal disclaimer
This package is developed to facilitate work with meteorological data made available by the Meteostat API (cf. https://dev.meteostat.net/).

I hereby acknowledge that Meteostat, c/o Christian Lamprecht, Plattenseestra√üe 5, 69168 Wiesloch, Germany is the provider of the data and that 
the legal ownership of data fetched using this package has to be checked on the case-by-case basis, depending on the provider of the data. 

This complexity is due to the fact that Meteostat acts as an aggregator of the data. For more background information please cf. https://meteostat.net/en/legal
